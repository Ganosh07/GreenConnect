# GreenConnect ♻️

**Slogan:**  
_"Connecting Communities, Cleaning Cities."_

---

## 🌱 Hackathon Context

Built for the **Innovate for a Sustainable Future Hackathon (August 2025)**, GreenConnect aims to foster community-driven sustainability in Indian cities.

---

## ❗ Problem

Despite growing environmental awareness, a major disconnect persists in Indian cities:  
- **Households** that diligently segregate recyclable waste often lack a reliable pickup mechanism.  
- **Informal waste collectors** search inefficiently for exactly these materials, roaming neighborhoods without clear guidance.

As a result, valuable recyclables end up in landfills—wasting resources and opportunities for sustainable livelihoods.

---

## ✅ Solution

**GreenConnect** offers a hyper-local mobile platform that bridges this gap.  
- **Direct connection:** Households post their sorted waste, and collectors see real-time opportunities nearby.
- **Efficient local economy:** Boosts recycling rates, ensures resources don’t go to waste, and empowers informal workers.

---

- 🗺️ **For Collectors:** View all nearby listings on an interactive, real-time map.
